Creating a branch: git branch *branch_name*

Switching between Git branches: git checkout *branch_name*
				      git checkout -b *branch_name* (both create and switch to)

Merging branches:
First git checkout development to move to the development branch
to merge feature branch commits into development: git merge *feature_branch_name*

Key Points:
Create new branches for each feature you are working on
Fully test the code before merging commits into development. Commit the code on the branch you are on before merging.
Always move to the branch you want to merge INTO first and then merge the branch you moved FROM
Merge conflicts will occur inevitably. Run git status to manually fix them or git mergetool to see a visualization of the conflicts

To delete branches remotly: git branch origin --delete fix/authentication

git reset --hard origin/development to move back to where the origin is. This will reset the state of the repository to the previous commit, and it will discard all local changes.
